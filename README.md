# uom-restyle-extension

A cleaner interface for the University of Manchester Blackboard with custom themes and dark mode. This provides a universal design to Blackboard with consistent fonts, colours and styling. It fixes many of the resizing and positioning issues present in Blackboard.

The following themes are available in both light and dark mode:
- Default (Purple)
- Blackboard (Grey)
- Ocean (Light Blue)
- UoM Purple (Same Purple as UoM Logo)
- Art Deco (Green and Gold Pattern)
- Tron (Black and Neon Blue Pattern)
- Rustic (Reddish Brown)
- Camo (Brown and Green Pattern)

# Setup
Available here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uom-blackboard-restyle/bfadimingfhacpedgapjpnhikcbjhbmn

Alternatively, download and unzip uom-restyle-extension.zip and load it in Chrome by clicking on "extensions" then "Developer mode" then "load unpacked" and selecting the unzipped folder.

Turn on the extension called "UoM Blackboard Restyle" to see the style changes appear. To choose the theme and switch between light and dark mode, click on the 
extensions button in the top right of Chrome and then "UoM Blackboard Restyle".

# Notes
- Assessment paragraph entry boxes on dark mode by default display white text but will submit black text (clearly visible on standard Blackboard). If you change the text colour, the submission will be this colour. Be aware that a submission of white text is not clearly visible on Blackboard.
- The following URLs are whitelisted by the extension (Blackboard won't warn you that you're leaving the learning environment): 'https://zoom.us/', 'https://piazza.com/', 'https://www.sli.do/', 'https://gitlab.cs.man.ac.uk/'.
- When first using the extension, it will warn you that it can read and change your data at online.manchester.ac.uk. It needs this access to apply style changes to the loaded page. No personal data is changed or stored.
