# uom-restyle-extension

A cleaner interface for the University of Manchester Blackboard with custom themes and dark mode. This provides a universal design to Blackboard with consistent fonts, colours and styling. It fixes many of the resizing and positioning issues present in Blackboard.

The extension requires the permission to read and change your data at online.manchester.ac.uk. This is how it loads your upcoming deadlines. No personal data is changed or stored.

# Description

Any deadlines on the Blackboard system coming up in the next 30 days are displayed on the left of the home page. Navigation links to the following are displayed below this: Student System, Timetable, Lecture Recordings, Exam Timetable, Exam Results, Library, SPOT, My Learning Essentials and Evaluation Kit.

The following themes are available in both light and dark mode: Default (Purple), Blackboard (Grey), Ocean (Light Blue), UoM Purple (Same Purple as UoM Logo), Art Deco (Green and Gold Pattern), Tron (Black and Neon Blue Pattern), Rustic (Reddish Brown), Camo (Brown and Green Pattern)

Course units on the home page are filtered by semester. The semester you are currently in will display by default.

The following URLs are whitelisted by the extension (Blackboard won't warn you that you're leaving the learning environment): https://zoom.us/, https://piazza.com/, https://www.sli.do/ and https://gitlab.cs.man.ac.uk/.

Assessment paragraph entry boxes on dark mode by default display white text but will submit black text (clearly visible on standard Blackboard). If you change the text colour, the submitted text will be this colour. Be aware that a submission of white text is not clearly visible on Blackboard.
